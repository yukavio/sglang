## Profiling SGLang Infer System with AMD GPUs
This AppNote describes the SGLang profiling technical, code augment and running steps for systems with AMD Instinct GPUs, nevertheless the same procedure may work with Nvidia GPUs too.
Examples and steps are provided in detail, to facilitate easy reproduce and use to localize performance problem towards optimizations.
Two primary methods are covered:
- [RPD](https://github.com/ROCm/rocmProfileData.git)


- [Torch Profiler](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes/profiler_recipe.html)
